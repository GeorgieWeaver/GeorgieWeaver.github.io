## Personal Project

For my professional and personal development module, I have worked with Roger Beecham, analysing data froom the US Presidential Election of 2016, in order to explore the geographies of the left behind populations within this political event. 


Within this, the overall aims were to carry out data analysis of the election results, where Trump became President of the US. This was done in R, carrying out data analysis to profile the spatial patterns of the vote, situated within the context of the social demographics and demographic changes of the population. The reason for this is to help understand the reasons why people voted for Trump, seeing how socio-economic factors influence the vote, and the types of people who vote Republican. 


Conclusion
-	Developed to profile the spatial patterns of vote within context of demographics 
-	Explored the relationship between the Republican vote and factors relating to pop
-	Overall, it has been found that these variables show voting intentions of US counties
-	Point towards conclusion that election was sparked by the ‘left-behind’ populations 
-	Issue, different populations of counties, 10 million for LA to 115 for Loving County
-	Area based analyses, cannot conclude anything about intentions of individuals 
-	Further work, can look at counties from scattergraphs that don’t fit with pattern
-	Incorporate twitter data, look at how both politicians and the public react
