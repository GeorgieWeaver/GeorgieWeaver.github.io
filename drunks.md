For my personal project, I am going to create an agent-based model that models drunks within a town, showing where they walk home.
This will involve mapping the area, highlighting where the pubs and homes of the drunks are.

Within this built environment, the drunks will be agents, who walk around randomly until they reach their home.

THe model will then store how many drunks pass through each point within the environment. 

An additional part of my model will be helping the drunks find their way home, and stopping them from retracing their steps.
