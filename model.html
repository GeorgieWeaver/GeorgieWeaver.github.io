  Agent Based Model 
</head>
<body>
<p> 
  I have created an agent-based model as part of my Core Programming for GIS module. </p>
  
 <p>
 An agent based model is iterative model, that contains agents within an environnment. The model then runs by allowing the agents to do 
 what has been set up in the code, over a certain number of iterations.
 This then allows patterns to be shown, and within the model the complex interactions of the agents can be seen. </p>

   To see the code for this model, please visit my GitHub repository LINK THIS
