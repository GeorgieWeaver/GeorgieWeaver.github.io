### Work Experience 

CACI International Data Project Intern, February 2017


Worked with CACI, carrying out an examination of websites of numerous outlet centres across Europe to update their brand list for existing and new centres. This contributed to an international project in scoring the attractiveness of retail outlets in a gravity model. Working on this project enhanced my research skills, whilst helping me to gain experience in the spatial retail sector.
